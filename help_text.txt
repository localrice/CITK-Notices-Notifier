Hello! My only purpose is to send you notifications whenever CITK posts any updates on their website's notice board. 
Since it doesn't have a system where it can notify students on updates,
it creates quite a lot of confusion among the students. I stand to solve that problem by notifying everyone who is
subscribed to me within 10 minutes. You can subscribe too, just by sending a subscribe to me.
And you can unsubscibe from me anytime you want!
Here's the source code if you're interested : https://github.com/localrice/CITK-Notices-Notifier
If you like the project consider giving it a star on github!
